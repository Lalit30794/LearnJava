## Introduction

Java is a powerful, platform-independent, object-oriented programming language widely used for building various applications. In these tutorials, you'll learn:
- Fundamental Java syntax
- Core concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data types
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
- Exception handling, file I/O, and more

## Setup & Installation

Before you begin writing Java code, make sure your development environment is properly set up:

1. **Download JDK (Java Development Kit)**: 
   - [Download the latest JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Set up IDE**:
   - Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/) to write and run your Java programs.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Java version printed on the screen.

## Java Basics

The basics of Java include:
- **Data Types & Variables**: Integer, Float, Boolean, String
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, Relational, Logical
- **Control Flow**: If-else, Switch, For loop, While loop
- **Methods**: Defining and calling methods, method parameters, and return types

Check out the detailed examples and exercises in the `basics/` folder.

### Example: Hello World Program
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Control Statements

Java control statements allow you to control the flow of your code:
- **If-else statements**
- **Switch-case**
- **For, While, and Do-While loops**

Go through the control statements [here](control_statements/).

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Java is a fully object-oriented programming language. These tutorials cover:
- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**

Explore OOP concepts [here](oop/).

## Advanced Topics

The advanced section covers:
- **Exception Handling**
- **File I/O**
- **Multithreading**
- **Java Collections Framework**

Learn more about these advanced topics [here](advanced_topics/).

## Project Examples

Practice what you've learned by building real-world Java applications. Some example projects include:
- Simple Banking Application
- Library Management System
- Todo List Application

Check out the projects folder [here](projects/).
